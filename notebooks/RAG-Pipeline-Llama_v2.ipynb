Provided your clip uses \\na Drum or Instrument Rack, one solution can be to extract the chain (page 325)  containing the \\nvoice that you want to independently groove.

There are two fundamental issues:\\n1. Latency refers to inherent and consistent delay in a system. This is a particular problem in a \\nDAW because digital audio cannot be transferred into or out of an audio interface in real \\ntime, and must instead be buffered. But even acoustic instruments exhibit a certain degree \\nof latency; in a piano, for example, there is some amount of delay between the time a key'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 16.1 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2021-04-27T15:43:15+02:00', 'moddate': '2021-04-27T15:49:50+02:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': '../documents/Ableton-Live-11-Manual.pdf', 'total_pages': 819, 'page': 789, 'page_label': '790', 'source_file': 'Ableton-Live-11-Manual.pdf', 'chunk_id': 1627}, page_content='of latency; in a piano, for example, there is some amount of delay between the time a key \\nis depressed and the time the hammer mechanism actually activates the string. From a per -\\nformance perspective, small latency times are generally not a problem because players \\nare usually able to adapt the timing of their playing to compensate for delays — as long as \\nthe delays remain consistent.\\n2. Jitter refers to inconsistent or random delay in a system. Within a DAW, this can be a par -\\nticular problem because different functions within the system (e.g., MIDI, audio and the \\nuser interface) are processed separately. Information often needs to be moved from one \\nsuch process to another — when converting MIDI data into a plug-in‘s playback, for ex -\\nample. Jitter-free MIDI timing involves accurate conversion between different clocks within \\nthe system‘s components — the MIDI interface, audio interface, and the DAW itself.

    ">  \n",
    "> In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), accurate retrieval is critical.  \n",
    "> Since most vector search relies on comparing **semantic similarity**,  \n",
    "> we often use **cosine similarity** to find relevant chunks.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> However, cosine similarity compares **direction**, not magnitude.  \n",
    "> If your embeddings are **not normalized**, the similarity score can be biased by vector length — leading to irrelevant results or lower-quality answers.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> 🔍 **Importance of Normalization in FAISS (Cosine Similarity)**  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> If you set `distance_strategy=\"COSINE\"` but do **not** enable `normalize_embeddings=True`,  \n",
    "> FAISS will default to using **unnormalized dot product** — not true cosine similarity.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> **As a result:**  \n",
    "> - Similarity scores may be skewed by vector lengths.  \n",
    "> - Retrieval results can become inconsistent or incorrect.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> ✅ **Solution:**  \n",
    "> Always normalize embeddings (both **chunks** and **queries**) before storing or searching.  \n",
    "> This ensures the dot product reflects **true cosine similarity**,  \n",
    "> where comparison is based purely on **direction**, not **magnitude**.  \n",
    ">  \n",

    "# Notebook 2 — RAG Pipeline (Llama + LangChain)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-end implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over research PDFs (React + Paracetamol).  \n",
    "Focus: grounding LLM responses using FAISS + embeddings instead of fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand RAG vs fine-tuning tradeoffs.\n",
    "- Implement embedding + FAISS vector storage.\n",
    "- Build retrievers and retrieval chains.\n",
    "- Connect retriever to LLM for grounded answers.\n",
    "- Build a PDF chat system.\n",
    "- Understand why embedding normalization matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM Limitations\n",
    "- Static training cutoff (no live data).\n",
    "- Hallucinations.\n",
    "- Not domain-aware.\n",
    "- Black-box reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tuning\n",
    "- Updates model weights.\n",
    "- Good for static domain specialization.\n",
    "- Expensive.\n",
    "- Not suitable for frequently changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG\n",
    "- Retrieve external documents.\n",
    "- Inject context into prompt.\n",
    "- Generate grounded answers.\n",
    "- No weight updates.\n",
    "- Lower hallucination risk.\n",
    "- Better for dynamic knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ingestion Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load PDFs**  \n",
    "   `PyPDFLoader` → returns `Document` objects (text + metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunk Documents**  \n",
    "   `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`  \n",
    "   - Overlap prevents answer fragmentation.\n",
    "   - Chunk size impacts retrieval precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Embeddings**  \n",
    "   `all-mpnet-base-v2` (HuggingFace)  \n",
    "   - Converts text into dense vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Store in FAISS**  \n",
    "   - VectorStore for similarity search.\n",
    "   - Persist locally for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Load VectorStore + Create Retriever**  \n",
    "   - Must use same embedding model as ingestion.\n",
    "   - Retriever returns top-k relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Connect to LLM**  \n",
    "   - `create_stuff_documents_chain`\n",
    "   - `create_retrieval_chain`\n",
    "   - Retrieval → prompt injection → generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Chat with PDF**  \n",
    "   - Full RAG Q&A pipeline.\n",
    "   - Supports multilingual queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Technical Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "When using cosine similarity in FAISS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `normalize_embeddings=True` is required.\n",
    "- Without normalization, FAISS defaults to inner product.\n",
    "- Retrieval quality degrades.\n",
    "- Bad retrieval → bad answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval quality drives system quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangChain** — orchestration framework.\n",
    "- **FAISS** — vector similarity engine.\n",
    "- **HuggingFaceEmbeddings** — open-source embedding model.\n",
    "- **Groq (Llama)** — fast inference LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Built\n",
    "\n",
    "- React paper vector database.\n",
    "- Paracetamol paper vector database.\n",
    "- Retriever objects.\n",
    "- Retrieval + generation chains.\n",
    "- Multilingual PDF Q&A.\n",
    "- Raw semantic similarity inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG performance depends primarily on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chunking strategy.\n",
    "2. Embedding quality.\n",
    "3. Retrieval configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM is the final reasoning layer — not the core intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If retrieval fails, generation fails."
