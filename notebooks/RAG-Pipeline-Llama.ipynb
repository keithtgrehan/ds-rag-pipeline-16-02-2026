    "> ⚠️ **Note: Why Embedding Normalization Matters in RAG (with FAISS + Cosine Similarity)**  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), accurate retrieval is critical.  \n",
    "> Since most vector search relies on comparing **semantic similarity**,  \n",
    "> we often use **cosine similarity** to find relevant chunks.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> However, cosine similarity compares **direction**, not magnitude.  \n",
    "> If your embeddings are **not normalized**, the similarity score can be biased by vector length — leading to irrelevant results or lower-quality answers.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "\n",
    ">  \n",
    "> 🔍 **Importance of Normalization in FAISS (Cosine Similarity)**  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> If you set `distance_strategy=\"COSINE\"` but do **not** enable `normalize_embeddings=True`,  \n",
    "> FAISS will default to using **unnormalized dot product** — not true cosine similarity.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> **As a result:**  \n",
    "> - Similarity scores may be skewed by vector lengths.  \n",
    "> - Retrieval results can become inconsistent or incorrect.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> ✅ **Solution:**  \n",
    "> Always normalize embeddings (both **chunks** and **queries**) before storing or searching.  \n",
    "> This ensures the dot product reflects **true cosine similarity**,  \n",
    "> where comparison is based purely on **direction**, not **magnitude**.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> ℹ️ Without normalization, FAISS effectively ignores your `COSINE` strategy and uses inner product directly. [source](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/32498)\n"

    "# Notebook 2 — RAG Pipeline (Llama + LangChain)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-end implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system over research PDFs (React + Paracetamol).  \n",
    "Focus: grounding LLM responses using FAISS + embeddings instead of fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand RAG vs fine-tuning tradeoffs.\n",
    "- Implement embedding + FAISS vector storage.\n",
    "- Build retrievers and retrieval chains.\n",
    "- Connect retriever to LLM for grounded answers.\n",
    "- Build a PDF chat system.\n",
    "- Understand why embedding normalization matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM Limitations\n",
    "- Static training cutoff (no live data).\n",
    "- Hallucinations.\n",
    "- Not domain-aware.\n",
    "- Black-box reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tuning\n",
    "- Updates model weights.\n",
    "- Good for static domain specialization.\n",
    "- Expensive.\n",
    "- Not suitable for frequently changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG\n",
    "- Retrieve external documents.\n",
    "- Inject context into prompt.\n",
    "- Generate grounded answers.\n",
    "- No weight updates.\n",
    "- Lower hallucination risk.\n",
    "- Better for dynamic knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ingestion Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load PDFs**  \n",
    "   `PyPDFLoader` → returns `Document` objects (text + metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunk Documents**  \n",
    "   `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`  \n",
    "   - Overlap prevents answer fragmentation.\n",
    "   - Chunk size impacts retrieval precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Embeddings**  \n",
    "   `all-mpnet-base-v2` (HuggingFace)  \n",
    "   - Converts text into dense vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Store in FAISS**  \n",
    "   - VectorStore for similarity search.\n",
    "   - Persist locally for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inference Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Load VectorStore + Create Retriever**  \n",
    "   - Must use same embedding model as ingestion.\n",
    "   - Retriever returns top-k relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Connect to LLM**  \n",
    "   - `create_stuff_documents_chain`\n",
    "   - `create_retrieval_chain`\n",
    "   - Retrieval → prompt injection → generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Chat with PDF**  \n",
    "   - Full RAG Q&A pipeline.\n",
    "   - Supports multilingual queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Technical Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "When using cosine similarity in FAISS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `normalize_embeddings=True` is required.\n",
    "- Without normalization, FAISS defaults to inner product.\n",
    "- Retrieval quality degrades.\n",
    "- Bad retrieval → bad answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval quality drives system quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangChain** — orchestration framework.\n",
    "- **FAISS** — vector similarity engine.\n",
    "- **HuggingFaceEmbeddings** — open-source embedding model.\n",
    "- **Groq (Llama)** — fast inference LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Built\n",
    "\n",
    "- React paper vector database.\n",
    "- Paracetamol paper vector database.\n",
    "- Retriever objects.\n",
    "- Retrieval + generation chains.\n",
    "- Multilingual PDF Q&A.\n",
    "- Raw semantic similarity inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG performance depends primarily on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chunking strategy.\n",
    "2. Embedding quality.\n",
    "3. Retrieval configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM is the final reasoning layer — not the core intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If retrieval fails, generation fails."
